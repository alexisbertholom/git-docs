# Introduction

This repository's goal is to document everything needed for a person unfamiliar with git, the team's workflow, or both, to be ready to collaborate on a project.
These docs are divided into 3 sections, that you can find below.

# Improving the docs

For these docs to be as complete as possible, we should try to expand them everytime we can.

If you find something is missing, incomplete or improvable, feel free to either:
- Open a github issue, so we can work on it
- Create a github pull request, so you can improve the docs by yourself
