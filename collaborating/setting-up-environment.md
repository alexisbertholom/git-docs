# Setting up environment

- Make sure your git version is at least 2.22. This version brought important features (such as `git rebase --rebase-merges`), that are needed for advanced git usage.
- Make sure your git is configured to pull in [Pull-rebase](/basics/pull-rebase.md) mode. Never pull in pull-merge mode.
